# KotlinMyBatis
This repository is sample repository for my friend implementation.

I did something below for that.
- [x] Creating demo project on Spring Initializr
- [x] Implementing sample code with using MyBatis static SQL. You can try it at http://localhost:8080/
- [ ] Trying mybatis dynamic SQL on kotlin.

I may try something more if he wants me to do something.
